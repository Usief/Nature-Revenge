# Artist Statement

The reason why I choose zero-carbon energy for my theme is the natural-human conflict is serious. From my experience, when I lived in China, I found people did not care about the natural environment when they took business activities. People heavily reply on carbon-based energies which have a serious impact on natural environment. As a result, the environment is heavily polluted. The air is with thick smog because of burning coal and the trees are cut for mining. Smog can hurt organism’s lung (Loomis, Grosse, Lauby, El Ghissassi, Bouvard, Benbrahim and Straif, 2013) and animals lose their home because of the disappearance of trees. I believe if human-beings continue to live in this way, we will pay for it in some ways, like London smog in 1952 when thousands of people died (Bell, Davis and Fletcher, 2004). This is the reason I made this “nature revenge”.

At the beginning, both sides have the same power. The viewers need to consider strategies to defeat the industry camp or protect self. As time goes by, the pollution may extend with the increase of the number of facotries and the angry of animals will increase. There will be reinforcement to support the natural camp. This indicates nature is much stronger than human. If nature fails, an earthquake will destroy everything.

I would like tell people we need to reduce the use of carbon-based energy to protect the environment through this sample game. I also hope people to consider the relationship between them and nature. It is important bacause many people live in urban cities and they do not have a chance to get close to nature.

I hope when the viewers leave the gallery, they could talk something about energies or natural environment. What can we do to reduce the emission of cardon to protect the enviroment.
